<h3>Writing</h3>

<u><b>Write an email to your friend explaining an interesting class you had.</b></u><br>
From: sandeepgaire8@gmail.com<br>
To: bhandari16@gmail.com<br><center>
Subject: <u>Interesting class that I had</u></center><br>
<br><br>
Dear Brinda,<br>
I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am doing pretty fine here. I am writing to you in order to share my experience of my English classes.
<br>
Compared to any other classes I have taken during my school history, I feel that no other class could give me so many joys, knowledge and pleasures than the English class could do. I learned it quite good and, in every test, I got the best mark in the class. I learned not only a lot of Basic English knowledge in my middle school but also the personal characteristics which lead my interests along through my later education life.
<br>
When I was in my middle school, it used to be a great thing when I know that there would be an English class tomorrow morning because I could enjoy another interesting 45 minutes during the class. Rather than other classes, like Science, Nepali or Mathematics, I established my English-relative interests’ group in social media, which give me a great benefit in my study in the university. I believe no other class can inspire me so far to pursue a scientific result.
<br>
Another important thing I achieved through the English class is to collaborate with other students. I think it certainly formed my teamwork sprite when I entered the career position as an engineer. I can still clearly remember my English teachers of primary school and high school. They are all the people of great patient and instructive characteristic. They told me not to quit when I failed again and again. They give me a lot of confidence and disciplines of the mind toward success. Saying that English class is the only class that I used to enjoy most, I would like to end this mail.

<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>

<b><u>a. What changes have started to occur in Nepali families in recent days? What impacts will they bring on the society? Discuss.</u></b><br>
Since the world is now in 21st century, everything is gradually developing through traditional culture to modern culture. Nowadays, people want to satisfy their feeling. They change their behaviour to family lifestyle in modern societies. They want to live in nuclear family with the full of happiness with child, husband and wife but other side in there is rapid increase of divorce in Nepal due to misunderstand in nuclear family. In Nepali families both male and female can rule household, country. Everybody male and female is getting equal right in family. Every family member understanding each other felling, happy and they can share their idea, concept in family member. In Nepalese families young age at marriage in Nepal is closely linked to the widespread practice of arranged marriages, where relationships and agreements between families prevail over individual choices. Thus, a decline in very early marriage, accompanied by a decrease in the interval between marriage and cohabitation, may indicate a change in the marital decision-making process and an increase in the level of involvement on the part of spouses in the formation of their own marital unions. Thus, they will bring both positive and negative changes on the society.<br><br>

<b><u>b. We see many elderly people in the elderly homes these days in Nepal. Some of them are abandoned while others live there willingly. Do you think Nepali people are deviating from their traditional culture? Give reasons.</u></b><br>
With the rapidly increasing number of aged, the care of elderly has emerged as an important issue in Nepal. Providing care for the aged has never been a problem in Nepal where a value based joint family system was dominant. This family structure has been the socio-economic backbone of the average Nepalese. The families were sharing the responsibility to look after their elderly by giving them all kind of support including emotional, psychological, behavioural or economic. They were getting full respect and value. They were living in the family till the end of their life. With the increasing influence of modernization and new life styles resulting in transitional changes in value system in recent times, the joint family is breaking down into several scattered nuclear families. Change in family structure and contemporary changes in the psycho-social matrix and values often compel the elderly to live alone or to shift from their own homes to some institutions or old age homes.<br><br>

Misbehaviour of children, financial crisis often lead to feeling of ignorance and lack of emotional support in elderly which often compel them to opt other places for living a problem free life. And, in present scenario along with other reasons elderly homes are being considered as a better alternative to reside. There is a need to generate emotional support facilities in these homes and the government and voluntary agencies in Nepal must make arrangements for institutional support and care for the elderly.<br><hr>

In today’s world when everything is losing its meaning, we need to realize the importance of family more than ever. While the world is becoming more modern and advanced, the meaning of family and what stands for remains the same. It does not matter what kind of family one belongs to. It is all equal as long as there are caring and acceptance. You may be from a joint family, same-sex partner family, nuclear family, it is all the same. The relationships we have with our members make our family strong. We all have unique relations with each family member. In addition to other things, a family is the strongest unit in one’s life.<br><br>

One cannot emphasize enough on the importance of family. They play a great role in our lives and make us better human beings. The one lucky enough to have a family often do not realize the value of a family. However, those who do not have families know their worth. A family is our source of strength. It teaches us what relationships mean. They help us create meaningful relationships in the outside world. The love we inherit from our families, we pass on to our independent relationships. Moreover, families teach us better communication. When we spend time with our families and love each other and communicate openly, we create a better future for us. When we stay connected with our families, we learn to connect better with the world. Similarly, families teach us patience. It gets tough sometimes to be patient with our family members. Yet we remain so out of love and respect. Thus, it teaches us patience to deal better with the world. Families boost our confidence and make us feel loved. They are the pillars of our strength who never fall instead keep us strong so we become better people.<br><br>

As we know that society is important for family. Society is the combination of one or more family member so, without family society cannot create. A family makes us responsible for our duty toward society. Family provides social security in the society. Family introduces you in the society. In the social world without a family an individual’s identity is never complete. And I think that family will change in future due to upgrading of modern technology, 5-10 year there is big family where very family member were residing but now day most of the family is living in nuclear family format.<br><hr>

<b><u>b. Some people think it is better to live in a nuclear family. Other people think that living in extended family is more advantageous. What do you think? Write an essay discussing the advantages and disadvantages of both.</u></b><br>
In my views both the Extended family and Nuclear family are better at their own place as both of them have some advantages and some disadvantages.<br>

Extended family is a combination of all generation of member. In these families, all member of the family including the children also grow with the belief that they also have certain duties and function to perform. They should learn to control their demand and expectation. In Nepal, more people prefer to stay in extended family and I’m also one of them in comparison to nuclear family. The advantage of extended family are, in extended family there is a good social and emotional relationship among the family members. There is a proper economic and social security. In extended family there is a proper care and supervision for the children also proper education and control over the problem of adolescence. The important advantage of extended family is a sense of protection of culture, tradition and values. There is not only advantage of Extended family but also some disadvantages occur in extended family. In extended it can push back in personality development. There is less privacy. There may be probability of low living standards. There may be difficult to meet needs and demand of each member in the family. Less of self confidence and dependency may increase in the extended family.<br>

Now talking about the nuclear family, Nuclear family is composed of husband, wife and their children, otherwise Extend family composed of grandfather, grandmother, parents, brother and their wives, daughter in-law, grandson etc., who share same kitchen and shelter up to four generation. Some of the advantages of nuclear family is that there is high understand and cooperation among each other, less possibility of quarrel among family member due the fewer members. It is easy to meet need and demand of each family.There is freedom of making decisions of their own. Also there are some disadvantages of having nuclear family as there is lack of security and confidence, there is lack of proper care of children and old age people.There is generation gap in respecting the norms and value of people. There is lack of love and care for the children if the couple engaged in professions.<br>

Thus in short we can say that both the nuclear and extended family are better at their own place.<br>

d. Penalty shoot-out has long been a bitter experience for the English team. Why?

e. State the contribution of Roberto Mancini to the Italian football.
Less than four years ago, Italy fell to the lowest point in its footballing history with failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. They are now the best team in Europe and with a national record of 34 games unbeatenunder Roberto Mancini. Mancini brought great confidence to the Italian football team and went all out to win the Euro 2020.

f. How does the Euro Cup final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals? How?
The Euro Cup Final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals because England also scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its opponent’s midfield before losing in extra time.


Critical thinking

a. “Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again.” Does this apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years?
Yes, the statement “Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again” applies to the Italian football team. Italy is constantly improving and investing more and more in the improvement of its football team. Despite having faced so many challenges, digesting so many defeats, we can say that they have continued to improve and now the football culture in Italy is second to none.

There is no place in the world where a typical technician is more qualified than another. Every casual Italian staff member is excellent in rehabilitation, strategy and organization. Wherever they go, they have a manager who can lead a top club to success. They have an upscale nightclub. Juventus has a rich history, well-organized organization and a management team that is able to bring out the best in every player they sign. Few clubs reach this level of competence, which should be the standard. Think of the three biggest clubs in Europe: Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester City.

In the last four years Italy has undergoneradical changes under Mancini. The Azzurri won 4-2 on penalties after taking the lead with Federico Chiesa, but came back from a draw by Alvaro Morata, who scored 1-1 goals and needed added time before the Italians won by 4-2 on penalties. From this we can say that Italian football team constantly learned from their past games and hence qualified for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years.

b. When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you think?
I think a team playing in the home ground gets huge support and confidence from their home fans but the teams from other places get huge disadvantages; according to their zone, climate, and fan follower. Many teams have been won Match on home ground. More than 100 teams won the match on the home ground.

In team sports, the term home ground – also called home field describes the benefit that the home team is said to gain over the visiting team. This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects by the supporting fans on the competitors or referees. Also, the players are used to, playing on their home ground due to which they can easily play there, despite of the weather, pitch or ground condition. But the visiting teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.

According to my views, in Euro Cup 2020 England lost the final match against Italy due to their fear and lack of faith. They had not won any match after 1966 A.D so that they had less hope and got more pressure from the home ground fans. Therefore, getting a huge support from the audience in the stadium does both i.e., supports the team to win the match as well as the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose.


Writing
<br>
A. The following passage does not have any punctuation marks. Punctuate it with appropriate punctuation marks.
