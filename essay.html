                        Everything that surrounds us constitutes the environment. Our natural environment includes the air we breathe, the water, oceans, forests, soil, vegetation, other living species etc., all are part of the environment. Today, this environment is threatened by a number of human activities leading to "Environmental Pollution". The term "Environmental Pollution" refers to the pollution of the environment, which constitutes our natural resources like water, air, habitation, soil, forests etc. Everything surrounding us constitutes the environment that we live in and its pollution is referred to as "Environmental Pollution".<br>

    Pollution is mainly caused by human activities. The main causes of pollution are population growth, urbanization, industrialization, deforestation, modernization, and migration, use of pesticides and lack of awareness of the people. Mostly, we can see pollution in urban areas where population is rapidly increasing. The density of population in cities is very high. Many people are immigrating to cities for various purposes. The waste product, vehicle, and industrialization in cities are main causes of pollution. The factory produces more waste product, harmful gasses and chemicals. Unplanned urbanization and industrialization have caused water pollution, air pollution and sound pollution as well. People are destroyed the forest for various purpose. Deforestation promotes air pollution. Most of the people are uneducated. They are not adequately aware. They pollute the environment in various ways.

    <br>If adequate measures are not taken today to control environmental damages, the day is not far when earth will become an arid planet unable to sustain life. Uncontrolled environmental pollution will soon lead to extreme climatic conditions and natural disasters like floods, famine etc. The nations must realize the urgency to make necessary policy changes and to raise awareness, taking adequate measures. towards slowing down environmental pollution. There could be hundreds of examples of human induced environmental pollution, but finding a solution to them, also lies only on humans.</p></article>

                    </div></div></div>

                    <p>
                        Advantages and Disadvantages of Cell Phone Cell phone or mobile is a very common means of communication in today's world. It is a developed form of telephone. It does not have wire. We can carry it with us and use everywhere. It can be very small to large in size and one can keep it on his/her own pocket while moving here and there. It is very wonderful equipment and essential part for each and every individual.    <br>  

     The mobile has become the key equipment for each and everyone. Today, it is very useful equipment to the human beings. It is seen very simple but contains various functions. It can be used for a number of purposes like - voice communication, sending e-mails, sending text messages etc. Browsing internet, taking pictures. Communicating with our loved ones, friends or colleagues has become a matter of seconds due to the mobile phones. You just have to dial the other person's number from your phone and wait till he/she responds to it. Mobile phones today have become so useful that, they have actually replaced the use of laptops and other bigger gadgets. Today, people send e-mails, browsing the internet, manage social media accounts, power point presentations, perform calculations, and much more by using their cell phones.
<br>
     Excessive and unnecessary use of a mobile phone leads to its abuse. Even, talking for long duration on mobile phones over trivial and insignificant issues, it is also a type of abuse. Another abuse of mobile phones includes listening to loud music. If you are using mobile phone for long hours daily it might lead to serious health issues. It is true that mobile phones can help students in studies but only if they use them wisely. Most of the students become addictive to mobile phones and are found playing games, chatting with their friends and watching movies and other stuff. If students are busy keeping their eyes on their mobile phones at all times they won't get time for studying which would lead to poor grades. There is high risk of accident if you are talking on the mobile phone and driving as you are giving your half attention to the mobile call and are having half attention on the road.
<br>
       Everything has positive and negative effects. It depends on how we use them. If used wisely, a mobile phone can be one of the best gadgets. We should try our best to make good use of this tool rather than to use it just for time-past purpose</p></article>

                        In the world that we currently live in, technology is a very vital factor. With each passing day a new software or gadget is being brought into the market that serves to improve our lives in one way or another and make it much easier. Technology is increasingly growing its importance in the education sector. The more technology advances, the more benefits it provides for students at every education level.<br>

      Using the new technology in education has become a center point of many researches and studies. Modern education has to combine with modern technology to come up with best results. The teacher and the student both can use the technology to enhance the teaching and learning strategies. To begin with, TV the invention that helps us to get useful information in easiest way. The most important advantage of television is that it is a huge source of information, knowledge and entertainment. Secondly, the internet which becomes the most popular technology in these days. It can be considered as the best way to keep in touch with friends from all countries over the world. In other words, the internet makes our earth as a small village. It actually has so many benefits; we can use to search for information and data for academic purposes. Students can always use the internet to get more information for their researches. If we take a closer look, internet is playing an essential role in education nowadays. Thirdly, computer assisted learning is being widely used by teachers and studied by researchers. Teachers use computers inside classrooms and give the students assignments to integrate the technology with the homework. A number of studies have been done concerning how the use of computer for language learning affects the development of language learners' four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing). Fourthly, a very immediate and practical way to improve education for kids right now is to push getting learning material to the cell phone screens.<br>

        To sum up, technology has many faces and means, and we should choose the appropriate use of technology to get the most benefits of it. We have to lead the technology, and don't let the technology leads us. TV, Internet, and mobiles are some examples of technologies we can't ignore using them in our daily life, and to follow the speed track you need to follow the speed of the technology. Using technology in education has become a fact in our lives. Advantages and disadvantages are issues to be further investigated in future researches.</p></article>

                          The world has reached to scientific era from the Stone Age. The calculation in old times was difficult but it has been easier after the invention of calculator. One of the most advance forms of calculator is computer. Computer is derived from the Latin word 'Computare' which means 'to calculate. Computer is the most important invention of the 20th century. Computer is the most powerful device to help the development in the field of data processing and research. So, it has become almost unavoidable in modern technologies.<br>

          Computers are used in all fields including home, business, school, hospitals, military, defence and many more. By the help of computers we can do accounts on them, learn languages from them, write letters on them, use them to control central heating, and in some places even do our shopping with them. Moreover, computers are used in industries, agriculture, medicine, tourism, banking network and communication. It is also used in small business offices to handle day-to-day work easily and efficiently. Due to the use of computer, the time span of many works has reduced. Any works can be done sitting in a place and pressing few keys. It has enabled people to know happenings of the world shortly after it happens. Computer has made it easier for people to communicate in addition to saving time and money. A chance of miscalculation is very less if done with computer than with a human brain. The use of computer in education sector has brought drastic changes in the age-old teaching materials. Multimedia system allows teachers to use computer for the effective educating. As in business and education computer is useful at home. Leisure time of family members does not become burden. They can sit at a place and spend time watching any movies they like. Computer puts a stop to writing letter, posting it and waiting for the reply. Needless to say computer has numerous advantages.<br>

         Nonetheless using computer has disadvantages too. Use of computer results into unemployment as computer can perform the duty that might need nearly six to seven workers. Unemployment is likely to result into crimes. The people who spend all their time talking to computers will forget how to talk to each other. They are completely mechanized. Their memory is also lost because computers do everything and they do not need to think. Continuous work with computer causes loss of eyesight in the long run. Internet is widely used to see pornographic scenes, corrupts the mind of teenagers. Due to it, <b>sex</b> violence increases rapidly. When computers teach all things to the people, people can forget to use pens and paper and forget to learn languages in classroom with real teachers. The fearful situation will come when computers may take over human beings.</p></article>

                    </div></div></div>

                   <article style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        
                    <p>
                        The fact of a number of people not having a job is called unemployment. In other words a person who has to pass time without having got a job to do is called an unemployed person. Unemployment is one of the most serious problems in Nepal. There are a number of educated as well as untrained people who have not got jobs. The number of such people is growing day by day. It is necessary to identify the causes and effects of unemployment.<br>

        There are many causes of unemployment in Nepal. First, the government has not been able to provide technical education at school level. Second, factories and industries are not flourished well to fulfill the demand of jobs. Next, many of the people aim at only government jobs, which are not enough. Nepal is rich in agriculture, but most of the educated people do not want to work in farming and there is no adequate development of agriculture sector. Moreover, Nepal has a lot of prospects of tourism which ca provide a lot of jobs; but tourism is not developed well and satisfactorily. Freque political disorder has also discouraged factories and companies to be developed. As a result, people have been hopeless about getting jobs in Nepal.<br>

        Unemployment has a lot of bad effects in Nepal. Many young people who are energetic and educated are going to other countries to do minor jobs. As a result our coun losing great manpower which is necessary for the country's development. Mary students who are studying in different grades have lost their belief in educational degrees. Consequently people's as well as countries' economic status is becoming weaker.<br>

          The problem of unemployment must be solved. People of all fields must do something in this regard. The government should make a policy of providing technical and practical education from the school level. This will really help the students to do some jobs in their community when they are matured. Next, tools and equipment should be provided for people to make them able to apply new farming methods. Similarly tourism must be developed widely. The existing factories and industries should be improved and new ones should be set up to meet the changing time and context. Young people should be stopped from going to other countries and they should be engaged in some kind of jobs in our own country, Nepal. This will increase people's living standard and indirectly more jobs will be created.
<br>
       The problem of unemployment is against the economic growth of people and the nation. One person's attempt or one community's effort or only the government's effort is not enough to solve this terrible problem. Everyone should do something to create jobs in the societies so that the influx of the Nepalese youths towards foreign employment is checked and the youth force is utilized in the development of the nation.</p></article>

                        Tourism plays a crucial role in the development of Nepal's economy. Nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, Nepal is a land of natural beauty and cultural diversity, offering a unique travel experience to visitors from all over the world. The tourism industry in Nepal generates significant revenue, creates employment opportunities, and promotes the country's cultural and natural heritage.<br>

One of the main benefits of tourism in Nepal is the contribution it makes to the country's economy. Nepal is considered one of the poorest countries in the world, and tourism is a significant source of foreign exchange earnings. The tourism industry contributes around 7% of the country's GDP and generates over 1 million jobs in various sectors. This helps in reducing unemployment and poverty, and provides people with a source of income.<br>

Tourism also helps in promoting Nepal's cultural and natural heritage. Nepal has a diverse culture, with more than 100 ethnic groups, each with its own unique traditions, customs, and lifestyles. Tourists visit Nepal to explore its rich cultural heritage and experience its festivals and celebrations. Similarly, Nepal is home to some of the world's highest mountains, including Mount Everest, and has several national parks and wildlife reserves. This makes Nepal a popular destination for adventure tourism, such as trekking, mountaineering, rafting, and wildlife safaris.<br>

Tourism also has a positive impact on infrastructure development. As the number of tourists increases, the government and private sector invest in improving infrastructure, such as airports, roads, transportation, and accommodation facilities. This not only benefits the tourism industry but also improves the living standards of the local population.<br>

In conclusion, tourism is an important sector in Nepal's economy, providing significant benefits to the country's social and economic development. It generates employment, contributes to GDP, promotes cultural and natural heritage, and improves infrastructure development. Therefore, the government and private sector should continue to invest in the tourism industry to ensure sustainable growth and development.</p></article>
